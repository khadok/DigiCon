## 1 Introduction

The objective of DigiCon is that let allow a doctor to write his prescriptions the
conventional way (i.e., using their pen and paper). From the scanned version
of the prescription, a handwritten text recognition is followed to capture the
data (name of the patient, symptoms, findings, prescription of medicine, tests,
advice, etc.) written by the doctor. Since, the accuracy rate of the state-of- the-
art hand written character reorganization is not still up to the acceptable level,
we propose to apply an error correction mechanism to reduce the errors. The
solution does not oppose the age-old convention and affordable as it is mostly
a software solution with a minimum hardware requirement.
